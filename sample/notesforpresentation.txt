PDO-
The main advantage of PDO to mysqli is the database driver support. PDO support 12 different
drivers namely CUBRID, MS SQL Server, Firebird/Interbase, IBM, Informix, MYSQL, Oracle,
ODBC and DB2, PostgreSQL, SQLite, 4D etc. with 18 different databases

MYSQLi-
With the mysqli it only supports mysql database


procedural and oop method
- for the "procedural" it was said that it was for amatuers, only used procedural
for simple programs and scripts 
- for the "oop" having more complex requirements and the program change over time
 oop might be a good choice in building bigger systems and applications.
